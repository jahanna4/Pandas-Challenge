# Pandas Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to analyze district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district.

Summaries for the district of total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, % passing math and reading, and overall passing rate were calculated as a base metric. Student, budget and score data was calculated for each school. Comparing scores by school and with the overall district scores, the top and bottom 5 schools were determined.
